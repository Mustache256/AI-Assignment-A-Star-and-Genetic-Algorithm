---------- FOR BOTH PROGRAMS: ----------

1. Please ensure that you are using either the ANSI or UTF_8 versions of the maze files you want the programs to read from.
2. Place the files you wish for the programs to use within the same folder as each of their respective EXE files, so that the programs
   will be able to locate and read from said files. If you wish to run the programs through the debug window within visual studio, then please
   also place the files within the folder containing the cpp and h files of each program.
3. When prompted by each program, please ensure that you input the name of the file you wish each program to read from accurately, including the designation
   of that file's type (e.g: MazeFileName1ANSI.txt).
